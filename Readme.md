# Internet of Dingens Operating System

This project is

- hosted on GitHub as a backup 😎
- undocumented 😱
- requires special ESP8266 based hardware 😵
- far from finished 🤓
- my playground to learn C++ 🤡
- a lot of fun 😎👍
- still a little buggy

My idea is

- create tiny sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure), and log data on a RaspberryPi, like many others have already
- to write some reusable code with C++
- reuse this code (*mainly the OSViews*) with multiple projects
- publish hardware design
- publish backend
- document everything
- have fun and learn


What works

- display temperature, pressure, humidity
- display uptime, time (can fetch time from http)
